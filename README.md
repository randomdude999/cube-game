# Cube Game
This is a (not so) old game of mine, which I coded from scratch without anything but Chrome (therefore some [helpful tutorials](http://html5gamedev.samlancashire.com/category/tutorials/)) and a basic text editor, but decided to import to GitHub for *absolutley no reason whatsoever* (no, actually for better management)

If you want to do something with the code (i.e. make a new version), email me!
Also, please credit me :smile:
